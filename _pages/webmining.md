## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project focuses on applying web mining and unsupervised learning techniques to analyze e-commerce product descriptions and reviews. The goal was to discover clusters, user patterns, and topic similarities to support product classification and recommendation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Use text mining techniques on product metadata and reviews
- Apply unsupervised learning to find hidden structures in data
- Evaluate clustering quality using silhouette scores and visualization

## ðŸ§° Tools & Techniques

- Python, pandas, scikit-learn, gensim, matplotlib
- TF-IDF vectorization, Word2Vec, LSA
- Clustering: KMeans, DBSCAN, Spectral Clustering
- Dimensionality reduction with PCA and t-SNE

## ðŸ’¡ Key Findings

- Spectral Clustering captured nuanced topic groups better than KMeans
- DBSCAN worked well on localized product groups with similar embeddings
- Word2Vec + PCA provided interpretable 2D projections for visual clustering
