## 📝 Project Overview

This project explores sentiment classification using both classical machine learning and deep learning methods on a dataset of Amazon reviews. The goal was to classify reviews into **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative** categories and evaluate how data imbalance impacts performance.

## ⚙️ Objectives

- Compare traditional classifiers (e.g. SVM, Random Forest) with LSTM-based models
- Handle class imbalance using data augmentation and stratified sampling
- Visualize results using confusion matrices and F1-scores

## 🧰 Tools & Techniques

- Python, scikit-learn, pandas, Keras, TensorFlow
- TF-IDF vectorization, tokenization, oversampling
- Models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM, LSTM

## 📊 Key Insights

- Traditional models like SVM and Random Forest performed best after balancing
- Deep learning required extensive tuning but gave promising performance on larger input windows
- Final F1-scores for SVM and RF reached ~90%
