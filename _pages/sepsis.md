title: "Sepsis Prediction Using Machine Learning"
permalink: /sepsis/
---

## ðŸ”¬ Project Overview

This ongoing Ph.D. research project explores the use of machine learning for **early detection of sepsis**, a life-threatening condition with high mortality. We focus on applying interpretable models to help clinicians identify sepsis onset in its earliest stages.

## ðŸ§ª Objectives

- Predict sepsis onset from structured ICU data (e.g. vitals, labs)
- Balance predictive power and interpretability
- Explore real-world clinical impact and deployment feasibility

## ðŸ§° Tools & Techniques

- **Python, pandas, scikit-learn**
- **XGBoost**, Random Forests, and **SHAP/LIME** for interpretability
- MIMIC-IV and hospital datasets
- Medical reasoning + bias mitigation

## ðŸ“ˆ Status

- âœ… Feature engineering pipeline completed
- ðŸ”„ In progress: tuning ensemble models and evaluating on real data
- ðŸ”œ Planned: calibration + explainability analysis for clinician trust

## ðŸ“‚ Files & Resources

> Full code and final write-up will be available soon.
